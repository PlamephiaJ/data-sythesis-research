Errrr....the biz guys in my office don't care what the \\\"WISPs\\\" want to do with their little WiFi networks.  And the bandwidth shadows in most cities are surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, which is pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next generation wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large scale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless configurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and others which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit considerations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize the canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless is tied into fiber at multiple points. The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, but a mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth measured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to well over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and bandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an order of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and proximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the cost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers can remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low bar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of large-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective bandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company's long-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to keep things sane. Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling, especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the system (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more efficient). -James Rogers  jamesr@best.com\",\n",

( in essence , i ' m talking about some kind of a dp - analysis . ) since possible noun phrase interpretations differ minimally across languages ( i guess ) , we would then assume that in languages without articles , the functional projection associated with the semantic properties in question would have phonetically empty heads . the possible tendency of acquiring articles could then be explained as a strive to fill this / these head / s with overt elements . unfortunately , i cannot say that i so far have any reason to be convinced about this line of reasoning , but i can't see any obvious reason to give it up either . however , i am ready to be butchered . i should probably read the following references provided by john e . koontz ( koontz @ alpha . bldr . nist . gov ) ) greenberg , joseph h . 1978 . how does a language acquire gender markers ? pp . ) 47-82 . in : universals of human language , vol . 4 , ed . jos . h . greenberg , ) et al . stanford , ca : stanford university press . ) discusses evolution of gender marking from articles and articles from ) demonstratives . see also : ) greenberg , joseph h . 1981 . nilo - saharan moveable-k as a stage iii article ) ( with a penutian typological parallel ) . journal of african languages and ) linguistics 3 : 105-112 . those interested in definiteness , especially with respect to english and finnish , should consult the following work provided by deborah d . kela ruuskanen ( druuskan @ cc . helsinki . fi ) . ) chesterman , a .

The culmination of the RPC vulnerabilities resulted in\\n   the  W32/Blaster  Worm,  which  affected many Microsoft users.

The W32/Sobig.F worm is an e-mail borne\\n       malicious  program  with a specially crafted attachment that has a\\n       .pif  extension.  The  W32/Sobig.F worm requires a user to execute\\n       the  attachment  either manually or by using an e-mail client that\\n       will  open  the attachment automatically. The CERT/CC has released\\n       an Incident Note on the W32/Sobig.F worm.\\n\\n                CERT Incident Note IN-2003-03\\n\\t\\tW32/Sobig.F Worm\\n                http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2003-03.html\\n\\n\\n    2. Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Microsoft RPC Interface\\n\\n       In  late  July,  the CERT/CC began receiving reports of widespread\\n       scanning    and    exploitation   of   two   recently   discovered\\n       vulnerabilities   in   Microsoft   Remote   Procedure  Call  (RPC)\\n       Interface.

W32/Blaster Worm\\n\\n       Shortly  after we released multiple documents describing Microsoft\\n       RPC  vulnerabilities,  we  began  receiving  reports of widespread\\n       activity  related  to  a  new  piece  of  malicious  code known as\\n       W32/Blaster.  The W32/Blaster worm exploits a vulnerability in the\\n       Microsoft  DCOM  RPC interface. On August 11, the CERT/CC released\\n       an advisory on W32/Blaster.

W32/Welchia\\n\\n       Additionally,  a  worm  was reported that attempted to exploit the\\n       same vulnerability as W32/Blaster. This worm, known alternately as\\n       'W32/Welchia',   'W32/Nachi',   or   'WORM_MS_BLAST.D',  has  been\\n       reported  to  kill and remove the msblast.exe artifact left behind\\n       by  W32/Blaster,  perform  ICMP  scanning  to  identify systems to\\n       target for exploitation, apply the patch from Microsoft (described\\n       in  MS03-026),  and reboot the system. The greatest impact of this\\n       worm  appears to be the potential for denial-of-service conditions\\n       within an organization due to high levels of ICMP traffic.\\n\\n   3. Cisco IOS Interface Blocked by IPv4 Packet\\n\\n   On  July  16, the CERT/CC reported on a vulnerability in many versions\\n   of   Cisco   IOS   that   could   allow   an  intruder  to  execute  a\\n   denial-of-service attack against a vulnerable device. We also released\\n   a companion Vulnerability Note on the same topic.\\n\\n          CERT Advisory CA-2003-15\\n\\t  Cisco IOS Interface Blocked by IPv4 Packet\\n          http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-15.html\\n\\n          Vulnerability Note VU#411332\\n\\t  Cisco IOS Interface Blocked by IPv4 Packet\\n          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/411332\\n\\n   Two  days  later  we  released  an advisory which provided information\\n   about  the  availability  of  a  public  exploit  for  the  Cisco  IOS\\n   vulnerability.\\n\\n          CERT Advisory CA-2003-17\\n\\t  Exploit available for the Cisco IOS Interface Blocked \\n\\t  Vulnerabilities\\n          http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-17.html\\n\\n   4. Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Libraries and Internet Explorer\\n\\n   During  this  quarter, there were a number of vulnerabilities reported\\n   in  Microsoft Windows Libraries and within Internet Explorer. Below is\\n   a summary of those vulnerabilities.\\n\\n    a. Buffer Overflow in Microsoft Windows HTML Conversion Library\\n\\n       A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a shared HTML conversion\\n       library  included  in Microsoft Windows. An attacker could exploit\\n       this  vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of\\n       service.  On  July  14,  the CERT/CC issued an advisory describing\\n       this vulnerability.\\n\\n                CERT Advisory CA-2003-14\\n\\t\\tBuffer Overflow in Microsoft Windows HTML Conversion \\n\\t\\tLibrary\\n                http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-14.html\\n\\n                Vulnerability Note VU#823260 \\n\\t\\tMicrosoft  Windows  HTML conversion library vulnerable \\n\\t\\tto buffer overflow\\n                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/823260\\n\\n    b. Integer Overflows in Microsoft Windows DirectX MIDI Library\\n\\n       A set of integer overflows exists in a DirectX library included in\\n       Microsoft Windows. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities\\n       to execute arbitrary code or to cause a denial of service. On July\\n       25,    the   CERT/CC   issued   an   advisory   describing   these\\n       vulnerabilities.\\n\\n                CERT  Advisory CA-2003-18\\n\\t\\tInteger Overflows in Microsoft Windows DirectX MIDI \\n\\t\\tLibrary\\n                http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-18.html\\n\\n                Vulnerability Note VU#561284\\n\\t\\tMicrosoft Windows DirectX MIDI library does not \\n\\t\\tadequately validate Text or Copyright parameters in MIDI\\n\\t\\tfiles\\n                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/561284\\n\\n                Vulnerability Note VU#265232\\n\\t\\tMicrosoft Windows DirectX MIDI library does not \\n\\t\\tadequately validate MThd track values in MIDI files\\n                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/265232\\n\\n    c. Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer\\n\\n       Microsoft     Internet    Explorer    (IE)    contains    multiple\\n       vulnerabilities,  the  most  serious of which could allow a remote\\n       attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user\\n       running  Internet  Explorer.  On  August 26, the CERT/CC issued an\\n       advisory describing these vulnerabilities.\\n\\n                CERT Advisory CA-2003-22\\n\\t\\tMultiple  Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Internet Explorer\\n                http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-22.html\\n\\n                Vulnerability Note VU#205148\\n\\t\\tMicrosoft Internet Explorer does not properly evaluate \\n\\t\\tContent-Type and Content-Disposition headers\\n                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/205148\\n\\n                Vulnerability Note VU#865940\\n\\t\\tMicrosoft Internet Explorer does not properly evaluate \\n\\t\\t\\\"application/hta\\\" MIME type referenced by DATA attribute \\n\\t\\tof OBJECT element\\n                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/865940\\n\\n                Vulnerability Note VU#548964\\n\\t\\tMicrosoft Windows BR549.DLL ActiveX control contains \\n\\t\\tvulnerability\\n                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/548964\\n\\n                Vulnerability Note VU#813208\\n\\t\\tInternet Explorer does not properly render an input type\\n\\t\\ttag\\n                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/813208\\n\\n                Vulnerability Note VU#334928\\n\\t\\tMicrosoft Internet Explorer contains buffer overflow in\\n\\t\\tType attribute of OBJECT element on double-byte character\\n\\t\\tset systems\\n                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/334928\\n\\n   5. Malicious Code Propagation and Antivirus Software Updates\\n\\n   Recent reports to the CERT/CC have highlighted that the speed at which\\n   viruses   are   spreading  is  increasing  and  that  users  who  were\\n   compromised  may  have been under the incorrect impression that merely\\n   having  antivirus  software  installed was enough to protect them from\\n   all malicious code attacks. On July 14, the CERT/CC issued an Incident\\n   Note describing this trend.\\n\\n          CERT Incident Note IN-2003-01\\n\\t  Malicious Code Propagation and Antivirus Software Updates\\n          http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2003-01.html\\n   ______________________________________________________________________\\n\\nNew CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) PGP Key\\n\\n   On September 5, the CERT/CC issued a new PGP key, which should be used\\n   when sending sensitive information to the CERT/CC.\\n\\n          CERT/CC PGP Public Key\\n          https://www.cert.org/pgp/cert_pgp_key.asc\\n\\n          Sending Sensitive Information to the CERT/CC\\n          https://www.cert.org/contact_cert/encryptmail.html\\n   ______________________________________________________________________\\n\\nWhat's New and Updated\\n\\n   Since the last CERT Summary, we have published new and updated\\n\\n     * Advisories\\n       http://www.cert.org/advisories/\\n\\n     * Vulnerability Notes\\n       http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls\\n\\n     * CERT/CC Statistics\\n       http://www.cert.org/stats/cert_stats.html\\n\\n     * Congressional Testimony\\n       http://www.cert.org/congressional_testimony\\n\\n     * Incident Handling Certification\\n       http://www.cert.org/certification/\\n\\n     * Training Schedule\\n       http:/www.cert.org/training/\\n   ______________________________________________________________________\\n\\n   This document is available from:\\n   http://www.cert.org/summaries/CS-2003-03.html\\n   ______________________________________________________________________\\n\\nCERT/CC Contact Information\\n\\n   Email: cert@cert.org\\n          Phone: +1 412-268-7090 (24-hour hotline)\\n          Fax: +1 412-268-6989\\n          Postal address:\\n          CERT Coordination Center\\n          Software Engineering Institute\\n          Carnegie Mellon University\\n          Pittsburgh PA 15213-3890\\n          U.S.A.\\n\\n   CERT/CC   personnel   answer  the  hotline  08:00-17:00  EST(GMT-5)  /\\n   EDT(GMT-4)  Monday  through  Friday;  they are on call for emergencies\\n   during other hours, on U.S. holidays, and on weekends.\\n\\n    Using encryption\\n\\n   We  strongly  urge you to encrypt sensitive information sent by email.\\n   Our public PGP key is available from\\n   http://www.cert.org/CERT_PGP.key\\n\\n   If  you  prefer  to  use  DES,  please  call the CERT hotline for more\\n   information.\\n\\n    Getting security information\\n\\n   CERT  publications  and  other security information are available from\\n   our web site\\n   http://www.cert.org/\\n\\n   To  subscribe  to  the CERT mailing list for advisories and bulletins,\\n   send  email  to majordomo@cert.org.

I need to tell the buildslave \\n> to execute two shell commands in sequence when it checks out the project \\n> for the first time. How do I do this?  \\n\\nTo make a single BuildStep execute multiple shell commands, there are two\\napproaches. The first is to do all the work on the buildmaster side, the\\nsecond is to do the work on the buildslave side.\\n\\nThe first approach has the advantage of not requiring buildslave changes,\\nwhich means you can use old buildslaves. Each BuildStep can trigger zero or\\nmore RemoteCommands, and RemoteShellCommand is a kind of RemoteCommand.\\nUnfortunately, I don't know if we have any examples of this sort of thing in\\nthere right now. I am planning to clean up the way RemoteCommands are started\\n(the goal is to make it behave just like regular twisted Deferred chains),\\nbut the changes got too destabilizing to make it into 0.7.6 .\\n\\nThe second approach (which is currently used by all the source-checkout\\ncommands) takes advantage of the fact that each RemoteCommand (on the\\nbuildslave side) can trigger zero or more actual shell commands. This\\napproach gives you better access (you can os.stat() files directly, for\\nexample) and offers marginally faster operations (fewer roundtrips), at the\\nexpense of only working with a buildslave that's new enough to have your new\\ncode. All of the Source steps use this, so look at those for examples, like\\nbuildbot.slave.commands.SourceBase and .SVN .\\n\\nThe SourceBase class has methods for doing a full checkout and for doing an\\nupdate: the VC-specific subclasses fill in those methods. SourceBase tries to\\ndo an update, and if that fails it triggers the full-checkout method.\\n\\nI'd recommand doing it on the slave side, and have the Git full-checkout\\nmethod do a chain of shell commands. I think the old Arch/Baz classes need to\\ndo something like this, so check them out for some hints.\\n\\ncheers,\\n -Brian\\n\\n\\nThis SF.net email is sponsored by: Splunk Inc.\\nStill grepping through log files to find problems?
