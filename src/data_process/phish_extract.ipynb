[Neil Schemenauer] > Spammers could exploit this including a large MIME part at the beginning > of the message.  In pratice that would probably work fine. Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at (except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type, Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME sections). Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting arbitrary amounts of \\\"nice text\\\" in the preamble area (after the headers and before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring scheme. But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they exist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for spammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what \\\"nice text\\\" is, not unless they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their messages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously. if-you're-out-to-make-a-quick-buck-you-don't-waste-a-second-on-hard-     targets-ly y'rs  - tim\",\n",

REGINA ROSSMAN.\\n#263 SANDTON CITY\\nJOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.\\nE-MAIL: joel_rose1@mail.com\\n\\n\\nATTN:ALHAJI\\n\\nWith due respect, trust and humility, I write you this\\nproposal, which I believe, would be of great interest\\nto you. I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.\\nJoseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal\\nto\\nMajor Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was\\nthe Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation\\n(G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the\\npeople targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of\\nthe revolution in the country, prominent people were\\nhijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.\\n\\nTwo days before his death, he managed to sneak a\\nwritten message to us, explaining his condition and\\nconcerning one trunk box of valuables containing\\nmoney, which he concealed under the roof. He\\ninstructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra\\nLeone, immediately to any neighboring country. The\\npowerful peace keeping force of the (ECOMOG)\\nintervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by\\nthe rebels, which was the order of the day.\\nEventually, it resulted into full war, I became a\\nwidow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner\\nat the moment of calamity, and every person was\\nrunning for his life. My son and I managed to escape\\nto South Africa safely with the box and some documents\\nof property title.\\n\\nThe cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million\\n(Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear\\nand limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items\\nwith a private security company in order not to raise\\nan eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my\\nsons name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real\\ncontent of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I\\nwant to travel out of South Africa entirely with this\\nmoney for investment in your country because of\\npolitical and economic stability and for future\\nbenefit of my child.\\n\\n\\nI want you to assist us claim this box from the\\nsecurity company and get the money into your private\\naccount in your country so that we can invest the\\nmoney wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding\\ninvestment and good relationship with you.\\n\\n\\nConcerning the money, we are prepared to give you\\nreasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.\\nAlso, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum\\nfor expenses that might be incurred by the parties in\\nthe course of the transfer both locally and\\nexternally. For the interest of this business, do not\\nhesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the\\nabove e-mail address immediately you\\nreceive this message for more information and to\\nenable\\nus proceed towards concluding all our arrangements. No\\nother person knows about this money apart from my son\\nand I. We await your most urgent response.please we\\nneed your fax/phone numbers for esiear communication.\\n\\nThanking you for your co-operation and God bless you.\\n\\n\\nBest regard,\\n\\nMRS.

AEP/HPL is negotiating on Enron's behalf to clear these historical imbalances.  Lobo wants to pay this gas back on Wednesday.  You guys can take this in and transport it on HPL to a market (for a fee, of course) or you can outright sell it to HPL after taking receipt at King Ranch.  It is up to you.  I realize that Wednesday may be short notice.  I was not a party to determining the date of this resolution and have no problem getting these guys to hold off, if need be.  Just let me know how you want to proceed.  I'm at 832-668-1181.

      "  \"text\": \"interval sessions at an anniversary fuzzy meeting \\n\\nDear Friends,  I realize that it is a very short notice, but I think it will be a very good  idea to organize a special session on the relation between fuzzy, interval, and  probability approaches - and on joint applications of these techniques, along  the lines of the special issues of Reliable Computing and Fuzzy Sets and  Systems and special sessions at fuzzy conferences organized and sponsored by  Weldon Lodwick, Dan Berleant, Scott Starks, and many others.  A lot of researchers are working in these areas, as most of you know Arnold  Neumaier published a fundamental paper in FSS, a lot of the relation has been  covered in NSF meeting on interval techniques in engineering organized by Fafi  Muhanna and Robert Mullen. There are many interesting applications to  engineering, including control, to geoinformatics, bioinformatics and other  areas.  Quite a lot of related papers were presented at a recent FUZZ-IEEE'05  conference in Reno, Nevada, where several special sessions were devoted to  interval-related topics - several, on interval-valued fuzzy sets organized by  Jerry Mendel (chair of IEEE Technical Committee on Fuzzy) and Bob John, one of  the main organizers of FUZZ-IEEE'06 in London, UK.  Interesting new interval-related algorithms were presented in a FUZZ-IEEE'05  paper by D. Dubois and others.  Dr. Masoud Nikravesh, the main organizer of this Berkeley meeting, has  encouraged us interval folks, at FUZZ-IEEE, to participate in FLINT'05.  This is one more good opportunity to make our interval methods even better  known to fuzzy community - in a celebratory conference in honor of 40th  anniversary of the publication of the 1st fuzzy paper, a conference that will  attract a lot of top researchers and top application folks.  To make this special interval session possible, we need, by June 10, 2005, to  send a list of potential authors and topics (see details below).  Please send me the info ASAP if you are interested in coming.

The successful applications of fuzzy logic and its rapid growth suggest that the impact of fuzzy logic will be felt increasingly in coming years. Fuzzy logic is likely to play an especially important role in science and engineering, but eventually its influence may extend much farther. In many ways, fuzzy logic represents a significant paradigm shift in the aims of computing - a shift which reflects the fact that the human mind, unlike present day computers, possesses a remarkable ability to store and process information which is pervasively imprecise, uncertain and lacking in categoricity. The BISC Program invites pioneers, the most prominent contributors, researchers, and executives from around the world who are interested in forging the frontiers by the use of fuzzy logic and soft computing methods to create the information backbone for global enterprises. This special event will provide a unique and excellent opportunity for the academic, industry leaders and corporate communities to address new challenges, share solutions, and discuss research directions for the future with enormous potential for the future of the Global Economy. Technical topics of interest include, but are not limited to:     Soft Computing Techniques/Methodologies/Tools   Fuzzy Sets   Fuzzy Logic   Knowledge Management/Discovery   Data Mining    Clustering    Hybrid System    Fuzzy-EC-Based    Soft Computing    Decision Analysis    Decision Tree & Support System    Case-Based & Rule-Based Reasoning     Agent Technology   Bioinformatics   Search Engine & Bioinformatics    Search Engine & Q/A System    Search Engine & Text Data Mining   Navigation    User Profiling   Search Engine & Internet   Spam    Knowledge Management & Discovery    CyberSecurity & Counter Terrorisms    Web Community    Fraud Detection    Information Filtering    Multi-Media    Data Mining    CRM/Customer Services  CALL FOR INVITED SESSIONS The goal of the invited sessions is to provide focused  discussion on a new topic, or innovative applications of a new approach. Proposals for invited sessions should be submitted  by June 10, 2005 to the Program Chair. Each invited session consists  of three-four papers, which will be reviewed through the normal process. The proposal should be submitted by the session organizer, and include a brief statement of the focus of the paper, short bio of authors (including title of 3-5 refereed papers) along with authors and titles of each paper submitted electronically. CALL FOR TUTORIALS Requirements for Proposals: Proposals for tutorials that address the technical topics related to the workshop theme are welcome. We encourage programs that will attract industrial members, and programs with high anticipated level of interest, impact, creativity. Tutorial Proposals must follow the format below and be submitted  via email to: flint-cibi@eecs.berkeley.edu by June 10, 2005. Please email only ASCII text, MS-word or Postscript files.  Proposal Format:  1. Title  2. Abstract/List of Topics (< 1000 words, indicate full or half day     tutorial)   3. Speakers (complete address, phone, and email. short Bio including title     of 3-5 refereed papers)  4. Motivation and Objectives (< 300 words)  5. Primary/Secondary Audience All reviews and interactions will be conducted via email. Organizers agree to collect written course notes from all speakers no later than Sept. 1, 2005.

A quick work-around is to do a \\\"chmod go+rx\\\" on that file (of  course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible). In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't  have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later  in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the \\\"unblessed\\\"  error.
